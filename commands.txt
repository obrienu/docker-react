Recently, a bug was introduced with the latest Create React App version that is causing the React app to exit when starting with Docker Compose.

To Resolve this:

Add stdin_open property to your docker-compose.yml file

  web:
    stdin_open: true


If you are using any version of Windows and your React app is not automatically reloading after a code change, you can add this environment variable to your compose file:

services:
  web:
    environment:
      - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
